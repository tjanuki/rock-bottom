#  Rock Bottom

## I NEVER WANT TO FEEL THIS WAY AGAIN

## The Path to Success is Not a Straight Line
The path to success is not a straight line. It's a rocky road with many ups and downs. But if you keep pushing forward, you will eventually reach your goals.

- It's okay if I am far away from my goals.
- It's okay if I am starting at the beginning.
- It's okay if I am at rock bottom and cannot yet see your way through.
- It's okay if I have failed every time I have tried to overcome it.
 
I will never accept my life getting to this point again.
